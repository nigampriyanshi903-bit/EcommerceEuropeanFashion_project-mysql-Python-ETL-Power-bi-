**Project Overview**
This is an end-to-end Data Analytics project focused on analyzing a European e-commerce fashion dataset. The primary goal was to process complex transaction and customer data to derive actionable business intelligence, focusing on sales performance, customer segmentation, and product trends across European markets.

**Key Features and Workflow**
This project highlights a robust data management and analysis pipeline:

**Data Engineering (Python ETL)**:

A comprehensive ETL pipeline was developed using Python. This included extensive data cleaning, transformation, and normalization of diverse e-commerce fields (e.g., product categories, pricing, regional data).

**Database Management (MySQL)**:

The clean, structured data was loaded into a MySQL relational database. This system was used for efficient storage, complex querying, and modeling the data before visualization.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:

Detailed EDA was conducted to uncover significant patterns and trends, such as:

Seasonal sales spikes and dips.

Top-performing product categories and regions.

Customer purchasing behavior analysis.

**Business Intelligence (Power BI)**:

A dynamic and interactive dashboard was created in Power BI. This dashboard provides stakeholders with clear visualizations on key performance indicators (KPIs) like revenue, average order value (AOV), and customer lifetime value (CLV) insights.

**Technologies Used**
ETL & Analysis: Python

Database: MySQL

Visualization: Power BI
